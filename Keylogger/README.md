This is a basic keylogger program mainly for windows which tracks key presses and sends them to the user as a mail using smtp protocol.
The extension .pyw is used so that the terminal window is not shown, and it cannot be tracked that the progeam is running.
In case you want to automate the program on the start of Windows you can add the .bat file to windows scheduler and rename it as update or something nominal not so suspicious so that even the user checks the schduler of processes he wont find the program.

This keylogger is ONLY for EDUCATIONAL Purposes and should not be used for any illegal activities.
Please follow the Ethical Code of Conduct, if you intend to use this program.
